# Quantum Transport and Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relations

## Project Description

This repository contains the numerical code used to analyze charge and heat transport in quantum-coherent systems, with particular focus on thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). The simulations include the study of a quantum dot and a double quantum dot using the Landauer-Büttiker formalism.

The project was developed as part of a Bachelor's thesis in Physics, and all computations were performed in Python using standard scientific libraries.

## Contents

* **Quantum Dot:** Numerical evaluation of current, noise, and TUR.
* **Double Quantum Dot (DQD):** Transmission function analysis, current and heat calculations, and TUR behavior as a function of inter-dot coupling.
* **Sommerfeld Expansions:** Small voltage analytical approximations of transport quantities.
* **Plots and Scripts:** Code for generating all figures used in the thesis.

## Usage

Run the Python notebooks or scripts in the respective folders. Make sure to install the necessary libraries (e.g., `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`) beforehand. Each script is self-contained and documented for reproducibility.
