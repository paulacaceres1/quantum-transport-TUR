# Quantum Transport and Thermodynamic Uncertainty in Nanostructures
This repository contains the Python code developed for the bachelor's thesis "COHERENT QUANTUM SYSTEMS OUT OF EQUILIBRIUM: THERMODYNAMIC BOUNDS AND TRADE-OFFS". The project explores charge and heat transport in quantum coherent systems using the scattering matrix formalism, with a particular focus on thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs).
